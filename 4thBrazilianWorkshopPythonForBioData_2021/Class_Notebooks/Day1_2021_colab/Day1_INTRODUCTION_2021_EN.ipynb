Execution Priority**\n","One essential piece of information when organizing formulas in Python is the order and manner in which we type the operations. Like in mathematics, there is an execution precedence for each operation, where a specific operation will have a priority over others. In the table below, you can see these priorities:\n","\n","| Priority | Character        |\n","|------------|------------------|\n","| 1st         | ```()```         |\n","| 2nd         | ```**```         |\n","| 3rd        | ```* /  // %```  |\n","| 4th         | ```+ -```        |\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"QRoN35T5zVLn","outputId":"847ece07-8ab5-403e-e9fb-d987f8956f54","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717373403466,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":68,"user":{"displayName":"Ubiratan Batista","userId":"15394635137392425432"}}},"source":["0.2 + 2 ** (1+9)/5"],"execution_count":26,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["205.0"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":26}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SIGRHlxX0P9w"},"source":["In the example above, you can see the order of all priorities.

However, we don't always need to reinvent the wheel. In Python, you can access predefined definitions and scripts and import them for use in your code. This is allowed through the use of modules. An important module to consider is the **```math```** module, which brings various functions that work with non-complex real numbers and makes programming tasks easier.\n","\n","To import a module is simple; you just need to add a line of code in the format `import [module_name]`. After that, you can call the desired function from the module: `[module_name].[function_name]`. Additionally, to make writing and reading the code easier, you can define an \"alias\" for the module by adding the alias at the time of module import: `import [module_name] as [alias]`.\n","\n","Some functions that can be useful are found in the table below:\n","\n","| Function/Variable | Description        |\n","|------------     |------------------|\n","| sqrt(x)  | Returns the square root of ```x``` |\n","| ceil(x)  | Returns the ceiling of `x`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x`      |\n","| floor(x) | Returns the floor of `x`, which is the largest integer less than or equal to `x`      |\n","| pi       | Returns the constant value of `pi`  |"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"mZ_T2vXF7YvJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717373403467,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":68,"user":{"displayName":"Ubiratan Batista","userId":"15394635137392425432"}}},"source":["import math as mt"],"execution_count":27,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"8nWrf0mn6HON","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717373403467,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":67,"user":{"displayName":"Ubiratan Batista","userId":"15394635137392425432"}},"outputId":"4e9c51ca-498a-4b93-b27d-f7fa19b81ef0"},"source":["mt.sqrt(100)"],"execution_count":28,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["10.0"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":28}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"KiL6MPVi9d5w","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717373403467,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":66,"user":{"displayName":"Ubiratan Batista","userId":"15394635137392425432"}},"outputId":"23d7b865-c648-433f-e5ae-f408bbfc6076"},"source":["mt.floor(23.5)"],"execution_count":29,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["23"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":29}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"lFJeVedf9jHn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717373403468,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":65,"user":{"displayName":"Ubiratan Batista","userId":"15394635137392425432"}},"outputId":"e51c70b5-b7ef-4419-f5b1-88cf64583224"},"source":["mt.ceil(23.5)"],"execution_count":30,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["24"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":30}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"oHrp7pNE9v8s","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717373403469,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":64,"user":{"displayName":"Ubiratan Batista","userId":"15394635137392425432"}},"outputId":"863412bf-f1d5-4f30-de17-3338c334c162"},"source":["mt.pi"],"execution_count":31,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["3.141592653589793"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":31}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TX4TrJc-AJWg"},"source":["---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"08Y9RB4vCMRM"},"source":["# Exercises\n","\n","1.
