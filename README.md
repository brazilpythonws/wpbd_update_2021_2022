# Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data

This repository contains materials from the **4th and 5th Editions** of the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data, held in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Our initiative focuses on teaching basic programming concepts and data handling techniques using popular Python libraries. The advancements and challenges encountered in these recent editions have been compiled into a manuscript, which can be accessed using the following link:

[Bridging the Python Training Gap for Bioscientists in Brazil: Improvements and Challenges]([https://](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.25.624749v1))

## Abstract

The rapid evolution of high-throughput technologies in biosciences has generated diverse and voluminous datasets, requiring bioscientists to develop data manipulation and analysis skills. Python, known for its versatility and powerful libraries, has become a crucial tool for managing these datasets. However, there is a significant lack of programming training for bioscientists in many countries. To address this knowledge gap among scientists in Brazil, the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data was introduced several years ago, focusing on basic programming concepts and data handling techniques using popular Python libraries. Despite the progress and positive feedback from earlier editions, challenges persisted, necessitating continuous adaptation and improvement to meet the evolving needs of bioscientists.This work describes the advancements made in the 2021 and 2022 editions of the workshop and discusses new suggestions for its ongoing enhancement. Key innovations were introduced in the workshop structure and coordination, including the creation of new committees and the establishment of a Code of Conduct. Feedback forms were updated to enable real-time adjustments during the event, improving its overall effectiveness. The workshop also expanded its reach by increasing geographical diversity among participants. New didactic strategies, such as pair-teaching, Code clubs, and the integration of information and communication technologies (ICTs), were implemented to enhance learning outcomes. Programming best practices and scientific reproducibility were emphasized through talks and hands-on activities, guided by PEP8 conventions. Furthermore, efforts to enhance scientific dissemination were intensified, with an increased presence on social media and participation in international scientific events and communication networks. Finally, we present updated recommendations for students, researchers, and educators interested in organizing and promoting similar events, building on those previously described.

## Workshop Structure

The full description of the workshop structure from both editions can be found bellow: 

Similar to the 2020 edition, both editions were structured online with the introduction of analysis, organization and data extraction using Python through practical sessions, employing a participatory live coding format [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008090). We designed both workshops to take place around five days of immersive Python learning, with a one-day break for exercises (S1 Table and S2 Table). They encompassed introductory sessions covering language syntax concepts and practical classes involving Python coding and programming logic. Lectures were developed using interactive digital notebooks on the Google Collaboratory platform (https://colab.research.google.com/). During problem-solving and concept presentations, instructors actively wrote and narrated the code for the students. We encouraged the students to write, document, and run their own code independently and concurrently. The full description of the schedule for both editions can be found in the repository link: In 2021, the practical sessions involved the manipulation of tabulated data, exploratory analysis with graphs, exploration of epidemiological data [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30120-1), and biological diversity. In 2022, the practical sessions involved manipulation of tabulated data, exploratory analysis with graphs, introduction to the manipulation of biological sequences, and exploration of size measurements for three species of penguins observed in different islands of Antarctica [[3]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090081). In both years, the third day of the workshop was reserved for required activities. In 2021, individual and group activities were required, whereas in 2022, only group activities were mandatory. Individual activities have become optional to reduce the workload on participants. A daily seminar related to the applied use of the Python language was given. On the fifth day, a special session called Flash Talks was held with selected participants for short presentations on their research, followed by a discussion on how the Python language could be applied to their own studies. All event communications - updates, and information throughout the event - were conducted using online platforms such as Slack (2021) and Discord (2022). For synchronous classes and presentations, we used Google Meet (https://meet.google.com/). An optional meeting preceding the workshop was scheduled with participants to clarify doubts related to the use of the platforms and as a way to minimize eventual technical complications. During the event, students were instructed to share errors and technical problems on the mentioned communication platforms (i.e. Slack or Discord) for immediate assistance from teaching assistants, for example, in solving syntax, semantics, and other general problems. As the days passed, students took it upon themselves to correct each other's mistakes and share feedback for solving exercises and technical issues among their peers.
