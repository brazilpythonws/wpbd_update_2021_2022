# 5thBrazilianWorkshopPythonForBioData_2022

The V Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data (WPDB) in 2022 was conducted online and free of charge from September 26 to 30, 2022. The workshop was designed to introduce data analysis, organization, and extraction using Python programming language, featuring an introductory lecture on Python syntax and practical sessions focused on programming logic. The practical sessions followed a “participatory live coding” format (NEDERBRAGT et al. 2020). During problem-solving and concept presentations, instructors wrote and narrated the code for the students, who were encouraged to write, document, and execute it themselves simultaneously.

A total of  40 participants were selected for the workshop, with 35 confirming their enrollment, and 24 agreeing to participate in the research. Among these participants, 70% reported having no prior knowledge of Python. The selection criteria for students included an analysis of their research activities, academic involvement, and expectations for the workshop.
During registration, an initial questionnaire was provided to the selected participants to gather relevant information regarding geographical distribution, sex and gender identity, birth decade, research institution, academic degree, field of expertise, programming experience, and expectations for the workshop. The desired profile consisted of participants with little or no experience in Python, from various Brazilian geographical regions, with an equal distribution between sexes, and who work with biological data. Of the 35 participants enrolled in the workshop, 24 signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF), which was fully available during registration, agreeing to and confirming their participation in the research**.

**The information and results described in this section follow the requirements established by the Human Research Ethics Committee of ESALQ/USP (Protocol No. 039771/2022) and were registered at the Brazilian Ethical Office (Plataforma Brasil: 58086522.2.0000.5395). All data were collected following these ethical standards, particularly regarding the confidentiality of sensitive participant information. The anonymized dataset is publicly available and can be accessed at the following DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.15306379](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15306379)

Similar to previous editions (the III and IV Brazilian Python Workshops for Biological Data, held in 2020 and 2021, respectively), an equal gender ratio was maintained in the participants selection, with 45.8% male and 54.2% female participants (Figure 1).

Additionally, participants provided information regarding their gender identity (Figure 2). Eleven participants identified as cisgender men (approximately 45% of the responses), while 12 participants identified as cisgender women (50% of the responses). Only one participant did not identify with any of the categories provided by the form ("Cisgender Woman," "Cisgender Man," "Transgender Woman," "Transgender Man," "Non-binary," "Other," "Prefer not to classify," "Prefer not to answer"), representing approximately 5% of the responses.

Furthermore, information regarding the participants' birth decade was collected. Interestingly, over 66% of participants (16 responses) were born in the 1990s (Figure 3), while approximately 16% were born in the 2000s and 1980s (4 responses for each).

The virtual format was maintained for the V Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data, which facilitated the selection and participation of candidates from different geographical regions of Brazil (Figure 4). Compared to the IV edition, there was a decrease in the percentage of participants from the Southeast region - from 70% to approximately 38%- indicating a less concentrated geographical distribution. Consequently, the Northeast region saw an 8% increase compared to the 2021 edition, rising from 12% to 20.8%. Notably, the North region also matched the Northeast's percentage, showing an increase of approximately 14% compared to the IV edition of the event. Finally, the Midwest region accounted for 12.5% of the participants, while the South region represented 8.3%.

Another criterion for participant selection was the proportional distribution of spots between undergraduate students and graduate students/researchers. One-third of the available spots were allocated to undergraduates, while the remaining two-thirds were designated for graduate students, professors and researchers. Figure 5 shows that in the 2022 edition, approximately 30% of the participants were undergraduates, while graduate students (including MSc and PhD students) made up about 63% of the participants. The remaining 8.3% of participants were postdoctoral researchers and professors.

Participants also provided information regarding their respective fields of expertise in science (Figure 6). Most participants work in the Biological Sciences (approximately 60%). However, the Health Sciences and Agricultural Sciences are also fields of study for 20% and 12.5% of the participants, respectively. The remaining participants (approximately 9%) work in interdisciplinary fields, such as Biotechnology and Bioprocesses.

During the selection process, we also evaluated the participants' profiles regarding their skills and knowledge of any programming languages, focusing on Python. Interestingly, approximately 60% of participants had prior experience with some programming language (such as Java, Bash, or R). However, all participants (100%) had either "Little" (30% of participants) or "No" (70% of participants) experience with Python programming, as shown in Figure 7. No participant reported having "Moderate," "Extensive," or "Advanced" experience with Python.

Additionally, participants also shared their expectations for the event. Although 66% of participants had previous experience with the analysis/manipulation of biological data (primarily omics and phenotypic data), 75% aimed to analyze biological data using the skills taught in the workshop, as shown in Figure 8. Furthermore, 20% of participants expressed interest in executing or developing computational tools related to bioinformatics. Finally, a small portion of participants (approximately 5%) aimed to become programmers, seeking more specialized or advanced knowledge, which falls outside the general scope of the workshop.

At the end of the workshop, a final questionnaire was administered to participants to evaluate the course's contribution to their learning and knowledge, assess the course's structure and organization, and report any challenges faced. Of the 35 enrolled and selected participants who consented to participate in the research, only 24 completed the course.
We assessed the participants' skills and knowledge of the Python language before and after the course. Among the 24 students who consented to participate in the research, 8.33% (2) did not respond to the final questionnaire, 45.83% (11) reported having no experience with Python, 33.33% (8) had little experience, 4.16% (1) had a good experience, and 8.33% (2) had extensive experience at the beginning of the course (Figure 9 - Q1). 

The assessment of skills and knowledge after the course showed that by the end of the workshop, 87.5% (21) had gained experience with Python, with 10 participants reporting moderate experience, 8 reporting good experience, and 3 reporting advanced experience (Figure 9 - Q2). Additionally, many participants noted that the workshop content aligned with their research, particularly in terms of graph production and data set manipulation.
