# 4thBrazilianWorkshopPythonForBioData_2021

The Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data (WPDB) in 2021 was conducted online and free of charge from September 20 to 24, 2021. The workshop was structured to introduce data analysis, organization, and extraction using Python. It began with an introductory lecture covering concepts related to Python syntax and programming, followed by practical classes in a “participatory live coding” format (NEDERBRAGT et al. 2020). During problem-solving and concept presentation, instructors wrote and narrated the code for the students, who were encouraged to write, record, and execute it themselves.
A total of 37 participants were selected for the workshop, most of whom had little prior knowledge of the Python programming language. The selection criteria included an analysis of the student’s research topics and their involvement in scientific activities, as well as their expectations for the workshop.
During registration, an initial questionnaire was provided to the selected participants to gather relevant information on geographical distribution, sex and gender identity, decade of birth, research institution, academic degree, field of expertise, programming experience, and expectations for the . Of the 37 participants selected, 35 signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF), which was fully available during registration, agreeing to and confirming their participation in the research**.

**The information and results described in this section follow the requirements established by the Ethics Committee on Animal Use (Protocol No. 06174/14) of FCAV/Unesp, Jaboticabal and was registered at the Brazilian Ethical Office (Plataforma Brasil: 45395321.0.0000.9029), particularly regarding the confidentiality of sensitive participant information. The anonymized dataset is publicly available and can be accessed at the following DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.15306280](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15306280)

Similar to the III Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data held in 2020, in the 2021 edition, the gender ratio was maintained at an equal level (around 50% each) among the selected participants (Figure 1).

**Figure 1.** The percentage of male and female participants.

Additionally, participants provided information regarding their gender identity (Figure 2). Eighteen participants self-identified as cisgender men (approximately 51% of the responses), while seventeen participants self-identified as cisgender women (approximately 48% of the responses). Only two participants did not identify with any of the classifications provided by the form.

**Figure 2.** Percentage distribution of participants who self-identified as "Cisgender man," "Cisgender woman," or "Prefer not to classify."

Furthermore, information regarding the geographical distribution and birth decade of the participants was collected. Among the participants, 60% (21 responses) were born in the 1990s (Figure 3), while less than 40% (13 responses) were born in the 1980s. Only one participant was born in the 1970s (Figure 3).

The virtual format of the WPDB facilitated the selection and participation of candidates from different geographic regions of Brazil (Figure 4). The Southeast region was the most represented, accounting for nearly 70% of those selected in the 2021 edition. The Northeast was the second most represented Brazilian region, with approximately 12%, followed by the North and South regions, representing 5.9% of the responses each. Participants who did not provide geographical information about their research institution were classified as "Others" (Figure 4).

Another criterion adopted in the participants selection was the proportional distribution of spots between undergraduate and graduate students/researchers. One-third of the available spots were allocated to undergraduates, while the remaining two-thirds were designated for graduate students and researchers. Figure 5 shows that in the 2021 edition, over 70% of the participants were graduate students (a combination of master's and doctoral students), while 20% were undergraduates. Additionally, the remaining participants were distributed among postdoctoral researchers (14.3%) and faculty members or researchers (2.9%).

Participants also provided information about their respective fields of expertise within Science (Figure 6). Most participants work within the Biological Sciences (45% of the participants). Agricultural Sciences was also the field of study for 34% of the workshop participants. The remaining participants were involved in Natural Sciences (approximately 11%) and Biotechnology and Bioprocesses (8.5%).

During the registration process, we also evaluated the participants' profiles regarding their skills/knowledge of the Python language. As shown in Figure 7, 80% of the participants had either "Little" (68% of participants) or "Moderate" (approximately 12% of participants) experience with Python programming. Only 20% of those selected had no experience or prior contact with the Python programming language (Figure 7).

Participants also shared their expectations for the IV WPDB. As shown in Figure 8, over 60% aimed to analyze biological data using the skills taught in the workshop. Nearly 30% expressed interest in executing programs and computational tools related to bioinformatics. A small portion (approximately 5%) of participants aspired to become developers/programmers, seeking more specialized or advanced knowledge that extended beyond the workshop’s general scope. One response, categorized as "Other" (Figure 8), highlighted a primary expectation of learning through practice ("to learn in a more practical way").

At the end of the WPDB, participants completed a final questionnaire to evaluate the course's contribution to their learning and the challenges faced. Of the 35 participants who consented to participate in the research, 27 completed the course. During the registration process, participants were assessed on their skills and knowledge of the Python language. Among the 27 enrolled students, 18.5% (5) reported having experience with Python, 14.81% (4) had little experience, and 55.6% (15) had no prior experience (Figure 9 - Q1). By the end of the course, a reassessment showed that 74.0% (20) of the students had gained skills and knowledge in Python (Figure 9 - Q2). Additionally, many participants reported that the workshop content aligned with their research, particularly in producing graphs and manipulating data sets.
